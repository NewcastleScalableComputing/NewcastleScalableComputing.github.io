__Abstract:__ Incomplete data, i.e. data with missing values, are common in almost any data generating domain. The missing values cause uncertainty and reduce the reliability of analysis results. The value of visualization as a tool for understanding missingness in data has been highlighted many times. Yet, very few visualization methods are able to support the investigation of missing values and how they relate to the recorded values in the data. In a previous talk this year I presented a study evaluating the usability of visualization methods for missing data. This talk will present a novel visualization method that is designed based on the results of that study, which can be used on its own or as an extension to common visualization methods. The talk will also present a set of metrics that can be used in conjunction with visualization to identify the potentially most interesting subset of data in a higher dimensional dataset, in context of missing data analysis. The talk is intended to present and get feedback on research that is to be submitted for publication â€“ all comments and thoughts will be much welcome.
